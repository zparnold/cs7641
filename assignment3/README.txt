1) You will need to download the code and data by checking out a git repo here: https://github.com/zparnold/cs7641 (i.e `git clone https://github.com/zparnold/cs7641.git`)
2) Go to the "assignment3" folder
3) You will need to install the following packages via pip
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* yellowbrick
* seaborn
4) Each portion of the paper has an associated python file, so for example to reproduce PCA results you'd need to run `python pca.py` or
correspondingly for ICA `python ica.py`.
