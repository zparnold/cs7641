\begin{itemize}
        \item Can you describe how the data look in the new spaces you created with the various algorithms?
        \item  For PCA, what is the distribution of eigenvalues?
        \item For ICA, how kurtotic are the distributions?
        \item Do the projection axes for ICA seem to capture anything "meaningful"?
        \item Assuming you only generate k projections (i.e., you do dimensionality reduction), how well is the data reconstructed by the randomized projections? PCA?
        \item How much variation did you get when you re-ran your RP several times (I know I don't have to mention that you might want to run RP many times to see what happens, but I hope you forgive me)?
        \item When you reproduced your clustering experiments on the datasets projected onto the new spaces created by ICA, PCA, and RP, did you get the same clusters as before? Different clusters? Why? Why not?
        \item When you re-ran your neural network algorithms were there any differences in performance? Speed? Anything at all?
    \end{itemize}
