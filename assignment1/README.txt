1) You will need to download the code and data by checking out a git repo here: https://github.com/zparnold/cs7641 (i.e `git clone https://github.com/zparnold/cs7641.git`)
2) Go to the "assignment1" folder
3) You will need to install the following packages via pip
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* pandas
* tqdm
* numpy

4) You nee Jupyter installed on your machine and you can find that here: https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html
(if you use PyCharm it should auto-recognize and ask you to install)
5) Each Dataset and Classifier has its own Jupyter Notebook. So if you want to run "kNN" on Dataset 1 as identified in the paper,
then you should open the file named "knn1.ipynp"
6) Once in a notebook, just execute the cells from top to bottom to replicate experiments, graphs, and values used in paper
